# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
df <- read.csv("activity.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
df$steps <- as.numeric(df$steps)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
grouped <- aggregate(df$steps, list(df$date), sum)
hist(grouped[,2])
mean(grouped[,2], na.rm=TRUE)
median(grouped[,2], na.rm=TRUE)
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
